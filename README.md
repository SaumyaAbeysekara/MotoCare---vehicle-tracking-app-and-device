# 🌐🚀✨ GPS Tracker with ATmega32, NEO-6M GPS, SIM900A GPRS, and 16x2 LED Display

## Overview
This exciting project involves the development of a GPS tracker using the mighty ATmega32 microcontroller, the accurate NEO-6M GPS module, the efficient SIM900A GPRS module, and a sleek 16x2 LED display. The tracker is designed to 🛰️ obtain real-time location information from GPS satellites, display the coordinates on an LED screen, and transmit the data to ThingSpeak channel for 🌐 remote monitoring.

## Features
- Real-time GPS tracking using the 📡 NEO-6M module.
- 16x2 LED display to show 🌍 latitude and 🌐 longitude.
- Data transmission to ThingSpeak channel via the 📡 SIM900A GPRS module.
- Automatic location update every 5 minutes ⏰.

## Components Used
- ATmega32 microcontroller.
- NEO-6M GPS module for accurate positioning.
- SIM900A GPRS module for data transmission.
- 16x2 LED display for on-device information.


## How it Works
1. The 📡 NEO-6M GPS module captures satellite signals and calculates real-time latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. The ATmega32 microcontroller processes the GPS data and displays the location on the 16x2 LED screen.
3. The 📡 SIM900A GPRS module establishes a connection with ThingSpeak and transmits the location data to a specific channel.
4. The process repeats every 5 minutes, providing regular updates to the ThingSpeak channel.

## Setup and Configuration
1. Connect the 📡 NEO-6M GPS module to the designated pins on the ATmega32 microcontroller.
2. Connect the 📡 SIM900A GPRS module for data transmission.
3. Attach the 16x2 LED display for on-device information.


## Usage
- Power on the device and wait for GPS signal acquisition.
- The LED display will show real-time latitude and longitude.
- Data is transmitted to ThingSpeak every 5 minutes for 🌍 remote monitoring.



## Project Status
Actively maintained
